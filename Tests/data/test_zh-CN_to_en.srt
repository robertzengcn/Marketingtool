00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello everyone, this is Grass Shoes.
2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This is Old Hua,
3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
and then what?
4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We're still waiting
5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
for a few days of express delivery here.
6
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Bought a little chicken oil and chicken green
7
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Get ready to do
8
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
a maintenance on this car.
9
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Because,
10
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
um,
11
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
if you leave Kunming,
12
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's
13
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
inconvenient to shop in the back of this
14
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Then 
15
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm going to go to Tibet and Xinjiang.
16
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Well,
17
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
what about this phase?
18
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
19
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Because recently this exercise sub-travel
20
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Well,
21
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
a lot about this topic.
22
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That is to say, some of my own
23
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Personal experience of
24
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
my this
25
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Travel to Southeast Asia
26
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
mainly takes place in
27
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Others are on their way to Africa
28
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And then,
29
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
um,
30
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
it went through this.
31
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Vietnam 
32
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Cambodia Thailand
33
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Sunny Lanka These
34
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Southeast Asian Countries
35
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
First and foremost, I'm most concerned
36
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Everyone is a safety issue
37
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Safety issues have been a problem
38
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
for me for more than a decade
39
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
For more than a decade of traveling,
40
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Say the biggest one
41
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The safety issue is that it happened in Malaysia
42
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
robbed in Malaysia in 1919
43
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And then, it
44
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
was a robbery of one of my phones.
45
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That was because I went to that
46
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Malaysia is the one to go to
47
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The black area,
48
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
that's the place.
49
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's just an unsafe area.
50
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And then this happened.
51
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yeah,
52
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
but when I went to the police,
53
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The cops said they didn't even dare go to that place.
54
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Speaking of which, if you're traveling outside,
55
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
First 
56
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
of all, because in every country, he
57
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
One language and this.
58
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Lockdown habits and
59
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
all sorts of laws.
60
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Everything is different
61
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
from everything else
62
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And then,
63
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
so what,
64
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
each and every
65
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
each and every one of these possible
66
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Maybe every one of these is different.
67
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
will create some problems.
68
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So,
69
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
um, if you're traveling outside,
70
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
is that you have to be good before you go.
71
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Plenty of power.
72
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, that would avoid
73
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Causes a lot of unnecessary trouble
74
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So, but I'm in Malaysia
75
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's a place called Sandagan.
76
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Because I'm going around for a walk.
77
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And then there was a bag on the back.
78
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And then take the phone and the dried fish.
79
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Because I have fish in my bag. Why?
80
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Just walking and playing.
81
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's a normal walk on the road.
82
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's a so-called black area.
83
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And then that place's
84
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Well,
85
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
the demographics of those places are quite complicated.
86
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I heard they're all illegal immigrants, a little more.
87
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Anyway, it's just being a
88
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
One by one, production is very
89
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
is to be toughened by a strong man
90
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That strong man is useless for my one
91
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Uh,
92
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
just take the dried fish, and then what? Just start.
93
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Just start attacking me
94
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And then I took my
95
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Then he grabbed my phone.
96
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I was also looking backwards
97
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
As soon as he snatched the phone away,
98
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
was to take my phone away from me.
99
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I ran away,
100
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and then I chased after it.
101
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And then we didn't catch up.
102
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Later, I passed the money on this mobile phone
103
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I got him back. How did I get him back?
104
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Because the person in this
105
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
place is the one who stole my mobile phone
106
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He's quite tall.
107
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Then the locals knew him.
108
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But, uh, also through
109
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
However, that is, through a local
110
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
is an elderly person.
111
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He said he could help me get my phone back.
112
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It costs a lot of money
113
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Later, this person who robbed me actually came with a swagger
114
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And then, just so I can pay for it,
115
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Get my phone back.
116
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Because I have a lot of pictures and stuff on my phone.
117
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Spend about 50 linen
118
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Probably just as much.
119
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Less than $100 should
120
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
This is a bit of luck.
121
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Then I went to the police station and called the police.
122
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The police department
123
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
says this about their people, they all
124
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I just don't want to go to that place
125
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's like there's too much of this.
126
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So, the most important thing is that you go to a place
127
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Uh, go a little bit safely.
128
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Because in my more than ten years of traveling,
129
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Why did this happen?
130
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
is what happens in a city.
131
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Because all my bad things happen in the city.
132
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
In the country, I...
133
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Usually speaking, poor travelers like me
134
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Usually a little more time on the road
135
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So it's usually some very biased places to go
136
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Somewhere in the countryside or something.
137
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Of course, it is not excluded that there will be other
138
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Something unexpected happened
139
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Uh, you,
140
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
including me, in Africa.
141
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I've been to some pretty biased places.
142
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's basically fine.
143
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
In fact, the most important security issue
144
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
They all come from people.
145
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And then,
146
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
so on the outside, one is for you to go.
147
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Go somewhere to get to know
148
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
and then to the local one.
149
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Also for you is one of the people contacted in the clouds
150
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
A defense consciousness ah
151
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Regardless of who you're traveling with
152
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Or is it better to say that the people outside
153
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Everyone must have a psychological awareness of defense
154
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Because 
155
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
people are popular.
156
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Then if it's really wrong, no one can do it for you.
157
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I basically live in a tent a bit more for all these years
158
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And then, how many of these daughters-in-law are there?
159
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000

160
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Uh,
161
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
but nothing bad happened.
162
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Because of me,
163
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
when the big account is bombing camp,
164
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The more biased you choose, the better.
165
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The more no-one, the better.
166
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The safer it
167
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
is, so what now?
168
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And I don't have much of a nightlife either.
169
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I smoke and drink again, and neither do I.
170
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So basically these
171
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It just eliminates some big insecure factors.
172
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
A lot of people like to go at night these days.
173
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Go play in the city
174
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And then,
175
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
in this case, the accident will be a little more
176
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Probably more likely
177
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
In addition, about
178
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
In fact, every country, no matter what country it is,
179
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's going to have something bad in it.
180
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So, no, no, no, absolutely safe place.
181
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and then some information about some of the reviews for the evening
182
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Maybe some of them he hasn't even been abroad.
183
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So you guys have to have your own.
184
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Discernment is the idea that you have to be yourself.
185
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
No, don't be swayed by these things.
186
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
A lot of things on the Internet, he's purposeful.
187
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Tell me about this cost-effective, cost-effective,
188
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
To be called cost-effective is to make a comparison with our country
189
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And then,
190
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
because my words mean to me, in fact, I spend very little in any country I go to.
191
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't live in a hotel, and then I eat
192
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Eating is easy, too. Most cities cook their own meals.
193
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
is to look at the scenery on the road a little bit
194
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Like this year, because the global economy as a whole is not good.
195
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And then
196
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
you look at this Thailand where prices are now going up.
197
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
However, compared to domestic
198
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's better if it's cost-effective.
199
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
When I was in Thailand, when that other person was passing through Thailand,
200
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I ate that risotto, but it was only 30 Thai dollars.
201
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
30 Thai pigs, this is me
202
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's only about 6 yuan
203
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Especially inexpensive.
204
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's definitely more than that now.
205
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Anyway, no matter where you travel, then
206
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Be sure to get to know some of the local
207
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
is that where you go, you must carry out an understanding strategy.
208
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
In a network where information is well developed, you can
209
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Anything you want to know can be found online. Be well-prepared.
210
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Then try to go out less at night
211
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Don't go to some like me
212
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Well, I never go to these bars or anything.
213
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But you, so everyone has to act for their own sake.
214
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Just pay the bill.
215
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Anyway, what we do is
216
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
No matter where you are traveling, whether you are at home or abroad
217
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Be careful of your own safety
218
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
After all, safety outside the home is always the first priority.
219
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
All right, that's all for today's video.
220
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Today, this Kumin is holding a marathon
221
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Now put the wind on this road
222
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I can't get out. This road is already bubbling marathons.
223
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I can't get out of this right now. Right here, watching them run marathons.
224
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Bye-bye.
